# HRTF Structural Model

WIP: In the context of headphone listening, 3D localization can be achieved using head-related transfer function (HRTF). The aim of this project is to build a structual model to synthesize binaural sound from monaural sound. The model is based on a simplified time-domain description of the physics of wave propagation and diffraction. Two methods are studied: a model of the human head, torso and pinna (part of human ear), and an impulse response based model based on measurements.
