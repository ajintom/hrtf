## An Auralization Framework for Virtual Acoustics:

This project aims to build a structural model for binaural sound synthesis followed by investigating aurlaization and stereo-to-binaural upmixing techniques using time-domain (acoustics modelling) as well as frequency-domain (signal processing) approaches.

The main source files are [/binauralModel/model.m] and [/binRIR/binRIR.m]

Dependencies include: [github.com/AudioGroupCologne/SOFiA]

For HRTF and HRIR plots run /binauralModel/run_*.m
